Benchmarks
==========

*snappy vs. zlib*

**Compressing:**

::

  %timeit zlib.compress("hola mundo cruel!")
  100000 loops, best of 3: 9.64 us per loop

  %timeit snappy.compress("hola mundo cruel!")
  1000000 loops, best of 3: 849 ns per loop

**Snappy** is **11 times faster** than zlib when compressing

**Uncompressing:**

::

  r = snappy.compress("hola mundo cruel!")

  %timeit snappy.uncompress(r)
  1000000 loops, best of 3: 755 ns per loop

  r = zlib.compress("hola mundo cruel!")

  %timeit zlib.decompress(r)
  1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 us per loop

**Snappy** is **twice** as fast as zlib

Commandline usage
=================

You can invoke Python Snappy to compress or decompress files or streams from
the commandline after installation as follows

Compressing and decompressing a file:

  $ python -m snappy -d compressed_file.snappy uncompressed_file

Compressing and decompressing a stream:

::

  $ cat uncompressed_data | python -m snappy -c > compressed_data.snappy
